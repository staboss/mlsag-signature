# MLSAG Signature
The raw python program that can generate MLSAG signatures.

## Cryptographic primitives
- Edwards25519 curve
- Keccak-256 hash function

## Todo
- [ ] Refactor math functions with curve points (I think they work not perfectly);
- [ ] The probability is 50% that signature is valid (Why? The answer is above).
